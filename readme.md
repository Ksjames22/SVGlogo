# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

**SVG Logo Maker** is a command-line application designed to help users generate simple SVG logos. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and then generates an SVG file. This tool is perfect for freelance web developers or anyone who needs a quick and easy way to create a basic logo without hiring a graphic designer.

## User Story

As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I donâ€™t have to pay a graphic designer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Text Input**: The application prompts for text input and allows up to three characters.
- **Text Color**: The user can specify the text color using either a color keyword or a hexadecimal color code.
- **Shape Selection**: The user is presented with a list of shapes to choose from (circle, triangle, square).
- **Shape Color**: The user can specify the shape's color using either a color keyword or a hexadecimal color code.
- **File Generation**: After entering all inputs, the application generates an SVG file named `logo.svg`.
- **Command Line Output**: The command line prints "Generated logo.svg" after the file is created.
- **SVG File**: The `logo.svg` file should be a 300x200 pixel image that matches the user's criteria when opened in a browser.
